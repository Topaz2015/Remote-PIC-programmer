# Remote-PIC-programmer
A programmer for PIC microcontrollers based on the ESP8266 WiFi module
I have been working with PIC microcontrollers since 2012. Recently (2016) I came accross the cheap WiFi module by the chinese company Espressif (also on Github @ https://github.com/espressif). I have been tinkering with it ever since. One thing I really loved about ESP is the ability to update the firmware over-the-air(OTA).

This project is about connecting 2 of my favourite MCUs to enable programming over-the-air for the PIC microcontrollers. I wish to start with just a few PICs, especially the ones I use often - PIC16F88 and its counterparts; and PIC16F1823 and its counterparts. More PICs could be added as time passes by.
